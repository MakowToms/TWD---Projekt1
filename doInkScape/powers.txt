Real Powers

Powers that we have classified as real are the ones we would expect for some humans to have too. Those include Agility, Durability, Intelligence, Reflexes , Invulnerability and many more that students need in order to complete their studies at MiNI.

Science Fiction Powers

We have classified as science fiction these powers which could be achieved through technology, such as power suits, thermal or telescopic vision. Other powers that we have counted as sci-fi powers include longevity, super speed and teleportation. 

Fantasy Powers

We have classified as fantasy all the powers that have to do with animal or space attributes, such as natural armour, dimensional awareness, shapeshifting, element control or energy absorption.  We optimistically classified mind control as a fantasy power, perhaps in favour of humanity.
